create a frontend page using 
React to show a list of tasks (2 tasks per row) with task 
description and status [colored according to the status] 
(Not Started - In Progress- Finished) 
with add, edit and delete 
functionalities for each task.

Please note that:

-      Functionalities are reflected on the frontend only (No endpoints). 

-       Use your own design that meets UI-UX requirements.

-        Create a component to render each task.

Bonus requirements:

-        Adding sorting,
          filtration,
           pagination to the list of tasks.

-        Dummy Login Page
-        Using Caching to cache the list of tasks


We are expecting to receive it within 3 days.
